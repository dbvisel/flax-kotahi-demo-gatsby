# flax-kotahi-demo-gatsby

Version of the Flax Kotahi demo done with Gatsby.

## Benefits:

- this is really easy to make
- built on React, so we can use Pubsweet component library

## Downsides

- Gatsby's support for ISR isn't great at this point.

## Remember

- Netlify build hook (which triggers rebuild) could be fired like this:
- 
- curl -X POST -d {} https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/61234a4e2d8c8275e0804bf5
